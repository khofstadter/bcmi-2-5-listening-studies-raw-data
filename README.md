The raw survey data is publicly available (open access) firstly as it was a requirement by one of the Facebook groups where the call was advertised, and secondly to provide data for researchers interested in meditation, visualisation, shamanism and auditory entrainment.

The studies are currently analysed and planned to be published in a relevant journal.
