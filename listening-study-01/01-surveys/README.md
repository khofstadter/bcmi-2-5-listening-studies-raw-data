# Surveys

The study started with one online survey in English language, however after receiving interest for Hungarian people who don't read English, the surveys was duplicated and translated to Hungarian language as well.

The pdf version of these two surveys are:

- SurveyMonkey_272592685-eng.pdf
- SurveyMonkey_275391881-hun.pdf

As a few interested people could not participate before the survey's official deadline, the survey was also formatted and embedded in emails:

- shamanic_meditation-eng.rtfd

The audio file embedded is a temporary mix of 'jester' from the audio release 'shamanic meditation - level two' {Hofst√§dter, 2019, #28011}. This temporary mix was created by Matty Moon {Half-ton Studios, 2008, #70328}. (The mixing of the audio files on the audio release are done by me based on Matty Moon's workflow. He used Pro Tools, I used Reaper.)

The audio file used in the survey was uploaded to SoundCloud and for aesthetic reasons its web player's code minimised with a custom code before embedding in the survey:

- audio_embed.rtf
