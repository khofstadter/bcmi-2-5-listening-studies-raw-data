# Survey Responses

The survey run between 21 November 2019 and 1 April 2020. The original data collected contain email addresses of most participants, however to secure anonymity I have removed this data and uploaded the amended .csv files to this GitHub repository.

This data is open access (public) ...

// *something legal needs to come here* //
