What I experienced was , it was very hard to withdraw from everyday thoughts and clear the mind and focus which might be due to no experience at meditation. I have done this meditation several times and finally I think I started to sense impressions that felt were messages. The last couple of times people and situations came to mind and I realize they are all related to betrayal. Where I betrayed people with or without being aware of it at the time. Some of them I have long forgotten, they came up now one after the other. Even from nursery at the age of 3, also with people I have not seen or thought of for decades and even family members who I talk to regularly but I forgot about those situations when I did not help them or hurt them. Had a strong feeling that whatever allows these situations happen should be not part of me and causes me difficulty to identify with my own past.   Not sure about the next step, but I will definitely make time for meditation thanks to this experience.   I hesitate to mention this, but... whenever I hear a number now, the countdown from the meditation keeps repeating in my mind. A silly example when a shop announces to open till 4, my mind will keep repeating level 4 and starts counting down with the same tone as in the meditation. Every time someone else mentions a number.

I could feel the energy that built up during the first half disappear and only come back slightly here and there. At times, my patience was strained and I felt like opting out sooner, but I'm happy I had the strength to carry on until the end. The outcome was positive though, even though I feel more tired, the edginess and discontent I was carrying with me throughout the day have been calmed a bit, which feels nice.

I was thinking quite a lot about the future, nothing really remained from those stories in my memory. Towards the end the flashing images became a bit more fluid, however, I didn't not see many clear shapes structures for a while. One thing that was continuous was the purple colour. It was just in patches at the beginning, however, later it came out of a mouth (female) as if it was smoke. I tried to see different colour but could not really. There was a time where I felt as I could lift this colour and see underneath where it was light blue. There was a house, that reminded me of a presshouse close to where the almond trees are.

With what I call a 'ground', it's normally something familiar or static that I can use as a guide-rope to follow through my meditation or experience. It can pull you forwards, or you can follow it passively.    With the lower frequencies of the drums, I find that richer, fuller frequencies on the lower end of the spectrum are what resonate with me best - particularly towards the last third of the performance, I could feel the speed of the drums directly pulling me faster through my trance. Oddly enough, normally when I meditate I try to slow things down to calm myself, but the frantic drumming sped things up, and still helped to calm me down, which before listening I would presume would only make my thoughts race faster."

My sense of movement also shifted to moving forward at a faster pace.  I noticed the REM seemed to have calmed down, but exactly at what point I can’t say.  I had the “image” of a broken skeleton appear.  When asked about this I was told it was me.  When asked for clarification I was told because I had been sick for several days with the flu that I needed to rebuild my energy body.  Made sense to me at the time.  This all took me to about 18 minute point where I felt I had gotten everything I was going to get and came back.

At one point I had some little inner light patterns going on, but very brief.   I ""woke up"" - became less drowsy and even opened my eyes, just a tad before your level 1 and 0 words... I felt heavy and calmy sedated for a moment. Now I feel relaxed. "

I was listening to the rythm and thinking that it has an effect on me. I am not sure how it happened but I must have dozed off. I was inbetween sleeping and awake for a while. I remember seeing very clearly trees without leaves against the sky on a grey autumn day. Much like today. At first I didn’t know if what I saw was real but then I remembered where I was and that my eyes were closed. After I enjoyed the rythm for a while and the journey was over.  Will go again sober and rested some other day."
