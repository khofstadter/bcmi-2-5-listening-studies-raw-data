# Surveys

The study was a part of an online presentation made for the Anglia Ruskin University Talking Science series running between 8-13 June 2020 {Hofst√§dter, 2020, #6002}. My presentation had two parts: a (1) 20 minute video introducing the research and the listening study and the (2) listening study using SurveyMonkey.  

The pdf version of the surveys:

- SurveyMonkey_285349906.pdf

As a few interested people could not participate before the survey's official deadline, the survey was also exported and formatted to be embedded in emails using raw text:

As in the earlier listening study, the audio file used were uploaded to SoundCloud and for aesthetic reasons the web players minimised before embedding.
