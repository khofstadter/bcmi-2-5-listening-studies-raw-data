1,Jun 30 2020 07:21 AM,"I usually have a difficult time meditating. It's hard for me to stop having thoughts while attempting to meditate and when I do have them, I try to notice them and let them pass without engaging in them. But this meditation was marginally different - I found it deeply relaxing and my mind was more engaged with the beats and far less distracted by the thoughts trying to intrude. I have never done shamanic journeying before but have friends who do it regularly and after this experience, well I am thinking about what more I could discover. It's inspired me at the very least to explore more in the world of binaural beats. ",

After a while on the upper right side i saw a dot of white light",

5,Jun 26 2020 05:00 PM,"Meditative, tranquil, focussed. That was how I felt after experiencing the journey. It started with me focussing on the content of the sound. As the soundscape progressed my focus shifted from the track to the closed eyed visuals. They were quite abstract, fractal, sometimes taking the same of leaves. I'm not good at drawing otherwise I would've shared them. The rest of the journey was a shift of focus between the visuals and my journey question.",
6,Jun 26 2020 12:01 PM,"The answer to my question came immediately, because I realized I already knew it. I felt happy and knew what things I want to pursue more. I had lots of associations and my thoughts ran freely. I tried to get back to just focus on the music occasionaly. I felt surprisingly sleepy. Now my body feels very relaxed and heavy. The journey brought things I knew to the surface with more clarity. It was a very pleasant experience and I feel refreshed but also a bit disoriented, like the subconscious has been stirred up and I need to digest the experience a bit. And I look forward to all sensations the day will bring and the path I will pursue in the future.                                                                                                ",

8,Jun 24 2020 12:55 PM,"At times it felt really good, like flying along with the music and then sometimes my thoughts took me out of it.",
9,Jun 24 2020 08:30 AM,"At first, I was planing in the space for a long time, then I arrived on a planet, which looks like the moon. 
There were some beings, I walked with them and went down to a big cave, where there was a lake, I swimmed in the lake with strange fishes.
Then I suddenly arrived in a place very green with a lot of grass, I could see also mountains, I was meditating there, humans arrived and meditate with me. After a while we all danced around a fire. It was symbolizing the union of appearance and vacuity. Then I traveled newly through the space to arrive in my room.
For the final minutes, I was just listening without new visualisation.

For the question I choose, I have had an answer, not precise, but a direction which I will perhaps follow.",
10,Jun 24 2020 04:01 AM,"began very jumbled / bubbly feeling then after a time moved quiet deep started to lighten when rythem changed to steady heavy beet surrounded in healing blue colour then kept coming back lighter to the end. Definately feel better than when commenced  more in balance and centred energy
",
11,Jun 20 2020 02:50 PM,"Until level 9: Dark jungle: a noisy party at night, dangerous, black snake, another party full of green and red lights across a lake
Level 8-6: falling in the lake but still moving towards the party across, emotional, struggling, flying out finally
Falling asleep after level 6
Level 1: waking up in a cave, bright day light around from a big opening above, dessert? beach? ",
12,Jun 19 2020 10:59 AM,"I usually medidate in silence without music but if I was to use music I would prefer a sound that doesn’t have a beat into it, a more ambient soundscape. I kind of struggled to meditate with the rhytmic beat on and I felt it more as listening to music instead of meditating.",
13,Jun 15 2020 11:25 AM,"Heavy sinking body 
Light head
Light even though my eyes are closed
Eyes feel like they have more space in my head
Not really imagery but light, and sometimes with a tunnel effect - none of the normal red black of my inner corporeal experience with my eyes shut 
Breathing slowing and shallow
Almost forget to breathe
Aware that breathing is originating from the muscles in my stomach
Wonder what it would be like to just stop breathing
",
14,Jun 15 2020 10:40 AM,I really liked the sound. I was worried about it finishing. I wanted that to last longer. At times I imagined I was moving/dancing to the rhytm. At one point I saw a purple spot dissapering like water in the drain. it kept reapperaing. The colour change to orange eventually. My mind kept drifting to some moments from past. I feel a bit sad actualy - not sure if because the sound has finished or because of the memories that came back to my mind. At one point I couldn't work out the position of my hands. They were folded on top of my stomach but I kept thinking about how and couldn't quite feel their position. I am eager to try this again.,
15,Jun 13 2020 12:36 AM,The main sensation was of my body being weighted down. By 15 my chest had sunk down. Electrical pulses rushing up my body from 8 down. Had to work to stay with it as so intense. Felt myself drifting into thought as often happens in meditation. Soundscape was a good anchor when this happened. 2 - 0 came from nowhere. Feels like I 'left' / ejected before a message was revealed. ,
16,Jun 12 2020 04:25 PM,"I found it really hard to stay still, the sounds made me want to move. I shook like I was shivering and I was distracted trying to find regular patterns in the levels i.e. did the volume/time between increase/decrease. Also it said to make sure my tongue was relaxed and that just made me realise wherever it was in my mouth felt wrong",
17,Jun 12 2020 10:31 AM,Relaxing experience. Felt mildly happy about halfway through. Mildly irritated and impatient at about Level 4 and 3. Better by end of recording,
18,Jun 11 2020 02:51 AM,The drums were novel and mostly pleasant to listen to. Some interesting patterns played through the various levels. Toward the very end though they became monotonous and not as appealing.,
19,Jun 10 2020 07:58 PM,jo,
20,Jun 09 2020 12:51 PM,At the beginning was focused on the sound of the drumming then as the sounds continued I felt a lot of bodily sensations and different thoughts/memories came up from when I have been meditating over the past few days. Overall it felt like a different experience from other types I have tried before - I am feeling very interested to try listening to something similar again perhaps for a longer period. ,
21,Jun 09 2020 11:38 AM,"Hard to focus on the sounds at the beginning, thinking lots about the question I set, then got more engaged with the sounds, imagery of many things, rainforests, water, psychedelic patterns, stress, animals being chased, processions, my own experiences. About halfway the deep sounds resonated through my body and around level 7 my hands and hips/ legs felt like they were floating. Harder to focus again nearer the end. Relief and peace at the silence of level 0.",
22,Jun 08 2020 03:03 PM,"My experience was very weird. I have tried different forms of meditatiton, over many years, but this was completely different. My head wobbled, which is fairly usual for me during medititation, but again this was different. My head movements just felt as though they were happening to me, and completely outside my control. Sometimes it was a small side to side movement, sometimes forward and back,  sometimes my head went in small circles one way, and then the other, and sometimes in quite large circles (towards the end). Although I felt physically very relaxed, and my hands pleasantly numb, I experienced moments of nausea. Now I feel quite heavy and a bit nauseous. I wasn't aware of my breathing slowing down, although it might have. Usually, in meditation, I am aware of my breathing slowing considerably. I felt inhabitated by the voice of the drum. That wasn't unpleasant, and I could feel it in my sternum. I was vaguely aware of you counting the levels, but didn't listen out for them.

Yesterday, I meditated to the sound of your video on youtube which was recorded at the Cambridge festival of ideas in 2019. I didn't experience nearly as intense sensations to that soundtrack: no nausea, found it pleasant, and slept like a log afterwards.

All the best with your thesis.",
23,Jun 08 2020 09:00 AM,My experience was colours and vague skyscapes with misty skies. When I felt most trance like (if that's what it was) I was seeing a deep purple colour. I wanted to let go into it but got distracted away from it with brief images from real life. When the sound scape included electronic type sounds I got images in my mind of paintings by Christophe Souques. These works include repeated small images on black and gold backgrounds. I sometimes look at these and think of old fashioned wireless sets with their electric wiring and soldering inside. I got a bit of this feeling from the sound scape. I was aroused / stimulated by the deep booming drum sounds. I want to explore this soundtrack more as I find it it very grounding compared with the sleep app soundtracks on the market which are too dynamic and musically articulated to be restful and mindful. Thank you. ,
24,Jun 07 2020 10:55 PM,"There wasn’t much at first and I was rather distracted at first but as the levels moved on I found I became more and more focused and clear headed. I had just a free visuals. One was for the briefest moment but interesting. It was something like two sea horses facing each other except the faces were more human. I had this feeling as if they were from different worlds yet meeting at that moment and the lack of differences between us was beautiful. Other than that, I had some energy visuals like a purple flaming ball. ",
25,Jun 07 2020 05:36 PM,"At the very beginning, I was attracted to the music, mainly
because it's new to me. I tried to focus on my breathing but
the music was quite distracting. I then fell asleep a few
times in the middle part. Towards the end, I was feeling a 
little bit uncomfortable due to my seating posture, so my 
focus shifted. Overall, the experience was similar to a 
mindfulness meditation. I reminded myself about my 
question twice during whole process. 

Sorry, did not watch the introduction video.
Say Hi to Antonia and Lucas!",
26,Jun 07 2020 11:33 AM,Physically very relaxing but mind chatter was persistent. Found the levels count down distracting. The simple beat from level four on was irritating. I would say I respond better to music with drums rather than just drums. I’d add a drone to the rhythm. I asked a work related question and think I have an answer that suits me. ,
27,Jun 06 2020 03:02 PM,"It took a while to settle, then i started to see imagery at level 10 onwards:

A winged animal that turned it a hummingbird with a long beak.

Then an ice breaker ship making it's way through the ice.

Then it felt like  was drifting through a void of purple.

Towards then end I saw figures with their arms stretched out...almost in a crucifixion pose,but they were dancing. 

Happy to be contacted ",
28,Jun 06 2020 10:49 AM,I focused a lot at the start and then my mind wondered off to my to do list,
