10,Jun 19 2020 10:26 AM,"I do 2 different techniques, the first one is called Vipasana Meditation in which I sit in a relaxed position with eyes closed and observe the rise and the fall of the belly, in that particular meditation nothing is a distraction, any thought, feeling, emotion etc is welcome, by the time I catch myself not observing the belly I get back into that observation and it goes on and on like that for an hour. The second one is called Zazen and it is zen meditation in which I sit in front of a blank wall staring with the eyes half closed and keeping the body movement to a bare minimum. It is amazing to notice how many hallucinations and thoughts the mind projects in order to prevent one from just doing nothing for 30 minutes.",
