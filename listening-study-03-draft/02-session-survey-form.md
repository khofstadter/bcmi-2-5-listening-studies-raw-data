## Part 2: Listening
Find a comfortable place where you will not be disturbed for 20-30 minutes. Sit or lay down, relax all your muscles, especially in your tongue and behind your eyes and think about a personal question you would like to seek clarity on. You will not have to share this question in the survey. Examples of questions could be: "Why is my relationship with X and Y difficult?", or, "How can I encourage myself to eat a healthy diet?"

A soundscape can be interpreted as a journey to the middle of an imaginary forest through several layers called levels. A soundscape starts outside the forest and moves gradually inwards and at the end when the soundscape reaches the middle of the forest, a 'call back' with the drumming suddenly slowing down and changing rhythm will ask you to return to the outside of the forest. The drumming in the levels when moving towards the middle of the forest become slower, more repetitive, less variable and slightly louder. 

When you reach the end of the journey, open your eyes and carry on with the survey's Part 3: After listening. 

While listening, occasionally remind yourself of the question that you would like to seek clarity on. As the music towards the end is slightly lauder, please adjust your volume now to a comfortable position. Also, please make sure your device does not pause the music when it goes into sleep mode.

While listening, try to focus on the most repetitive parts of the music, the computer generated drumming. As mentioned earlier, they will gradually become more stable to help your meditation. Consider this drumming as your anchor. Surrender your attention to this anchor. Whenever your mind wanders off to think about the past or the future, try to reattach your attention to your anchor. Do not be harsh with yourself, this is very difficult. Be patient, "practice makes the master".

After a while (usually around 10-15 minutes) you might start seeing internal visual, dreamlike imageries. If you like what you see, if you think what you see can provide you with interesting insights, then some of your attention now should start slowly be allocated to sharpening and maintaining these visuals. By this time your anchor should be stable, so you can let go and follow your intuitions. Try not to analyse the experience while experience it, this usually interrupts the experience. You can do this later, after the listening part.
